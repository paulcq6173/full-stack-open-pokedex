# Summary

## For JavaScript continuous Integration(CI) workflow, like linting, testing, and building, we can use specific tools as following:

1..gitlab-ci for linting
for example: using gitlab-ci-multi-runner as our solution, 
there's a official document url: https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/ .
You will run gitlab-ci-multi-runner with the docker executor that will run your CI jobs in docker containers. Once you have configured some runners, add them to your Gitlab project so they're available to run jobs.

2.Testing Frameworks for Javascript - Cypress
I had used this tool, it's a powerful tool that you simulate browser behavior to test and find out possible errors.
As official web said:
With Cypress, you can easily create tests for your modern web applications, debug them visually, and automatically run them in your continuous integration builds.

Follow the official guide below when using cypress:
https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress

Cypress enables you to write all types of tests:
    End-to-end tests
    Component tests
    Integration tests
    Unit tests

3.Nx Agents for building
Nx is a build system with built-in tooling and advanced CI capabilities . It helps you maintain and scale monorepos, both locally and on CI.

Introduction from official web:
Nx is a powerful open-source build system that provides tools and techniques for enhancing developer productivity, optimizing CI performance, and maintaining code quality.

Core Features include Run Tasks Efficiently, Cache Locally & Remotely, Automate Dependency Updates etc.

## Which CI/CD tool should we choose?

Selecting the optimal CI/CD tool requires astute consideration of your project’s unique needs and your development team’s capabilities. When choosing a CI/CD tool for your project, consider these important factors:

  Open Source Support: Check if the CI/CD tool is compatible with open-source projects and aligns with your project’s goals.
  Build Environment Compatibility: Ensure that the tool works well with your project’s environment and programming languages to speed up integration.

  Hosted and Cloud-Based Options: Consider whether the tool offers both cloud-based and hosted solutions, and choose what suits your project needs.

  Version Control System Compatibility: Verify if the CI/CD tool can integrate with your chosen version control system or source control platform for seamless code management.

  Testing Integration: Evaluate how the tool integrates with testing frameworks or test management systems, and check the types of testing it supports (unit, integration, etc.).
